# Beginner JavaScript

Course by [WesBos](https://courses.wesbos.com). The goal is to learn JavaScript (mostly) from scratch. From the day I'm starting this course I know _some_ JavaScript, but my knowledge is kind of chaotic, specially when it comes to actually building things.

I'll be updating here as I go through the course, and hope it shows my development (pun intended) as I learn.

Credits for the [`base.css`](./base.css) file and the [`htmlbase.json`](./htmlbase.json) snippet go to Wes Bos.
